I am a researcher in quantum information and quantum optics. I study how the quantum properties of light can be used to transmit and process information. My work focusses on continuous-variable systems (see [Research](/research/) ). 


I obtained my PhD from the École Normale Supérieure of Paris and Paris Sciences Lettres, working at Laboratoire Kastler Brossel. Later I worked as a postdoc at LIP6, Paris. 


Since September 2020, I am a Humboldt postdoctoral fellow at the  Freie Universität Berlin.
