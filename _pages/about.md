Hi! I am a researcher in quantum information and quantum optics. I study how the quantum properties of light can be used to transmit and process information. My work focusses on continuous-variable systems (see [Research](/research/)). 

Since September 2023 I hold a Junior Professor Chair at [INRIA Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-paris-centre), affiliated with the [informatics department](https://www.di.ens.fr/) of École Normale Supérieure, where I am a member of the [QAT Team](https://qat.inria.fr/) (Quantum computing Architectures, Algorithms, Applications and their Theory). 

I obtained my PhD from the École Normale Supérieure of Paris and Paris Sciences Lettres, working at Laboratoire Kastler Brossel.   

Later I worked as a postdoc between the QI team at LIP6, Paris and the MOCQUA team at LORIA, Nancy. 

Between September 2020 and August 2023, I was a postdoc at the  Freie Universität Berlin.
