My past research has focussed on bridging theory and experiments towards the realization of continuous-variable (CV)) quantum information processing (QIP)) tasks. The phrase CV refers to the use of systems described by infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, most commonly consisting of collections of harmonic oscillators (sometimes called qumodes). 
Specifically I have worked on protocols that may be implemented with multi-mode light. This was mostly inspired by the experimental setup built in the multi-mode quantum optics group at Kastler Brossel Laboratory in Pris where I completed my PhD. This setup can be used to produce squeezed states of light from optical frequency combs and nonlinear optical media. 
Such states can further be made non-Gaussian (which is essential for continuous-variable) through mode-selective photon subtraction.
These features are also available in a variety of other systems studied for CV-QIP. My work can be loosely divided in three main branches, detailed below.
